# Fuzzy-Search
Fuzzy Search implemented through C++.
This repository allows searching a string of words through a directory of different text files with the following features:
	
1. The words may have different words between them(ie a slope as we call it)
2. The searching is CASE-INSENSITIVE
3. The words may have spelling error

The output shows the complete paragraph where the desired string was found.
